## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering:Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

2. Props:A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

3. JavaScript Events:An event is an action that occurs in the web browser, which the web browser feedbacks to you so that you can respond to it.

4. Object-oriented programming:Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. ... Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method.

5. Ruby:is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
